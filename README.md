## Project Overview
This project showcases an analysis of bike rides in London, leveraging data cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques. I used Tableau for data visualization to create an interactive dashboard, and a Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and analysis using Python. The dataset includes various features of bike ride trips in London, such as trip duration, start/end locations, and weather conditions.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset/data


## Steps Taken

### Data Cleaning
- Imported the dataset and renamed columns for better readability.
- Converted the `season` column from numerical to string format to enhance interpretability.

### Data Visualization
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to showcase insights from the data.
- Key visualizations include trends in bike ride frequency according to seasonality, moving average period, and moving average duration (by day, month, and year).

## Key Insights
- The Moving Average visualization highlighted clear seasonal trends, with increased ride activity during specific months.
- The Temperature vs. Wind Speed heatmap showed that weather conditions significantly influence riding behavior.
- The Hourly Distribution chart revealed peak usage times, offering valuable insights for optimizing resource allocation and operational planning.
